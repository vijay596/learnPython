📝 Problem Statement: Simple ATM System

Design a Python program that simulates a basic ATM machine.

Requirements:

PIN Verification

The system should ask the user to enter their ATM PIN.

If the PIN is correct (e.g., "1234"), allow access.

If the PIN is incorrect, display "Wrong PIN. Exiting..." and stop the program.

Menu Options (should repeat until the user chooses Exit):

1 → Check Balance → Display the current balance.

2 → Deposit Money → Ask for deposit amount, add it to balance, and show new balance.

3 → Withdraw Money → Ask for withdrawal amount:

If amount > balance → show "Insufficient balance!"

Else deduct amount and show new balance.

4 → Exit → End the program with "Thank you for using Python ATM. Goodbye!"

Initial Balance → Start with ₹1000 by default.

Loop Behavior → The menu should keep showing until the user selects Exit.
